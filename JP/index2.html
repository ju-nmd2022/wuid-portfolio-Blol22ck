<h1> Jönköping City</h1>

    <h2>What to do?</h2>
    <p>Jönköping is a beautiful city with lots of activities. 
        Whether you like to party, go to the cinema or just hang out in the park, Jönköping has it all. 
        There is also a fine lake with the shore along the north side of the city. </p>
    <h2>Where to go out?</h2>
    <p>If you have not visited the city yet I have some great suggestions. 
        Why not start the evening with a tasty burger at Badabing Burgers? 
        Followed by a beer or soft drink at Shooters, where you can also play pool and dart. </p>
        <h2>Restaurants</h2>
        <p>I have two places to eat that are my favourites.
            The first one is Badabing Burgers because they have very good burgers as well as an great atmosphere at the restaurant.
            The second place is STUK where they have amazing italian style pizza.</p>
